# Resources

## Introduction

**SciEcon Resources** is to collect and share useful research and innovate resources, not only for reference and use within SciEcon but also for communication and sharing with all researchers and industry experts. Both the members at SciEcon CIC and also the public audience can share, upload, and use the recourses in SciEcon Resources Database. SciEcon E-Board is responsible to review and approve the newly added content in the database on a regular basis.
