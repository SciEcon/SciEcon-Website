# Resource

## Introduction

SciEcon Resources is to collect and share useful research and innovate resources, not only for reference and use within SciEcon but also for communication and sharing with all researchers and industry experts. Both the members at SciEcon CIC and also the public audience can share, upload, and use the recourses in SciEcon Resources Database. SciEcon E-Board is responsible to review and approve the newly added content in the database on a regular basis.

## Open Education Resources (OER)

SciEcon aims at creating open education resources (OER) of the community, by the community, for the community. Our founding president Prof. Luyao Zhang has been leading an Industry 4.0 Open Education Publication Initiative that calls for collaborations among university faculties, students, staffs, and beyond to create multi-media (OER) that serves the digital transformation of education in Industry 4.0. Since now, three collections have been created:

- **Series No. 1 Innovate on the Internate Computer**: [https://ic.pubpub.org/](https://ic.pubpub.org/)
- **Series No. 2 Intelligent Economics: An Explanable AI Approach**: [https://ie.pubpub.org/](https://ie.pubpub.org/)
- **Series No. 3 Computational Econnomics**: [https://ie.pubpub.org/](https://ie.pubpub.org/)
