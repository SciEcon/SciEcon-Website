#### SciEcon AMA Distinguished Scholar

## SciEcon for Sustainability

As humanity faces unprecedented challenges such as climate change and a global pandemic, sustainability has become an indispensable endeavor for a better future. At SciEcon, sustainability has been a key focus since SciEcon's foundation. SciEcon strongly endorses projects that are shaping a sustainable world. We demonstrate our commitment to sustainability through interdisciplinary research including sustainable finance, ESG investment, carbon neutrality & carbon market, blockchain governance, risk management, and education for an integrated talent, etc.

### SciEcon in Actions

The pursuit of sustainability is a joint endeavor and SciEcon is a part of it. As countries and companies all over the world pledge to achieve carbon neutrality, a think tank said the UN's 2050 aim to decarbonize the world was a "mission possible." SciEcon is also actively contributing to sustainability through actions in research, innovation, and leadership. Besides endorsing [research](https://medium.com/sciecon-research) projects, we foster sparks of innovation regardless of its format, from developing software to hosting seminars. For instance, to enlighten more talents, SciEcon launched the AMA (Ask Me Anything) series where aspiring scholars of SciEcon interviewed experts on topics at the forefront of their fields. These interviews are published on [Medium](https://medium.com/sciecon-ama) as our open education resources and shared with a broader audience.

### How to Support Us
